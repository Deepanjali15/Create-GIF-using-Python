Create GIF using Python

Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to create animated GIFs from a collection of images using Python. By leveraging the Pillow, NumPy, and ImageIO libraries, this script reads multiple images, resizes them to a consistent dimension, handles different color channels (RGB or grayscale), and generates a looping GIF in just a few lines of code.

Key Features:

Combine multiple images into a GIF.

Automatic resizing to a uniform width and height.

Supports both color and grayscale images.

Fully configurable GIF duration and looping.

Minimal code, easy to understand and reuse.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

Pillow (PIL) for image processing

NumPy for array manipulation

ImageIO for GIF creation

Usage:

Place your images in a folder (e.g., images/).

Update the script to point to your images or use the automatic folder scanning option.

Run the script:

python create_gif.py


A GIF (team.gif) will be generated in the project folder.

Purpose:
This project is ideal for beginners looking to explore image processing, automation, and Python scripting. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn how to manipulate images and create animations programmatically.
