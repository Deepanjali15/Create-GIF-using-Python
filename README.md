**Project Description:**
This project demonstrates how to create animated GIFs from a collection of images using Python. By leveraging the Pillow, NumPy, and ImageIO libraries, this script reads multiple images, resizes them to a consistent dimension, handles different color channels (RGB or grayscale), and generates a looping GIF in just a few lines of code.

**Key Features:**

1. Combine multiple images into a GIF.

2. Automatic resizing to a uniform width and height.

3. Supports both color and grayscale images.

4. Fully configurable GIF duration and looping.

5. Minimal code, easy to understand and reuse.

**Technologies Used:**

1. Python 3.x

2. Pillow (PIL) for image processing

3. NumPy for array manipulation

4. ImageIO for GIF creation

**Usage:**

1. Place your images in a folder (e.g., images/).

2. Update the script to point to your images or use the automatic folder scanning option.

3. Run the script:   python create_gif.py

4. A GIF (team.gif) will be generated in the project folder.

**Purpose:**
This project is ideal for beginners looking to explore image processing, automation, and Python scripting. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn how to manipulate images and create animations programmatically.
